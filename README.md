# CPP_Final
A photo manipulation program I coded for a C++ class at Cogswell Polytechnical College. Command-Line Image Processing Program or CLIPP for short -- It performs several operations on the given photo types including: resizing by a fixed amount(double or half), colorizing(red, green or blue), rotation and morphological operations(cleaning up the image).
